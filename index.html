        <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
        <p>Computer programming is creative. It allows us to change the world! Students of all skill ranges are welcome to take computer science classes at SHA. Computer science is a top paying career and computer programming jobs are growing at two times the national average. Many top colleges and companies are making efforts to recruit female computer science students, making it an ideal time for women to pursue computer science degrees. <br><br>
        
        
        Computer science is a field that allows students to explore problem-solving and design in highly personal ways. The hands-on learning is engaging, applicable to the real world, and outstanding preparation for virtually all careers in STEM. Coding projects provide students with opportunities to unify their logical and creative thought processes and to work in teams that leverage each member's unique strengths.
 </p>
        
        <h2>Computer Science Concentration at SHA</h2>
        <p>The Computer Science Concentration is a concentration that begins freshmen year. Courses in computer science are taken each year. No prior experience is necessary. Students should sign up for the computer science concentration if they are genuinely interested in learning about:</p>
